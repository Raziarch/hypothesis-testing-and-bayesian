    "In the last lecture, we performed a hypothesis test to try to identify a significant effect on sales in a coffee shop based on running a happy-hour promotion. Let's summarize those results again:\n",
    "1. Over a one week period of each treatment, the happy-hour trial saw an average increase in daily sales of \\$80.92\n",
    "2. We formulated a two-sided paired t-test with an error value of $\\alpha = 0.05$. \n",
    "3. The test produced a p-value of $0.09$, so we failed to reject the null hypothesis. \n",

    "1. What motivated the choice of $\\alpha = 0.05$? After all, if we set $\\alpha = 0.1$, we would have rejected the null hypothesis. \n",
    "2. What if the experiment gave us an average daily sales difference of only \\$10, but a p-value of 0.049? Does the result with more statistical significance also carry more real-world significance?\n",
    "3. Let's say that the over the last 3 months, raising prices by 25 cents at another store location increased sales by an average of $130.24. Was our investigation at the new store informed by our prior beliefs? Moreover, do the results of the experiment affect those beliefs?\n",

    "Suppose 40% of customers of a popular coffee shop order iced drinks, and 30% order pastries. Suppose that 15% of people order both iced drinks and pastries.\n",

    "- What is the probability that a customer ordered an iced drink given that they ordered a pastry?\n",
    "- What is the probability that a customer ordered a pastry given that they ordered an iced drink?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answers to these questions rely on **conditional probability**, the probability of an event occurring *given* knowledge that another event has already occurred. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation\n",
    "- Let A denote the event that a customer orders an iced drink.\n",
    "- Let B denote the event that a customer orders a pastry.\n",

    "2. P(AB) tells us that 15 out of 100 customers will order a pastry and an iced drink.\n",
    "3. This means that 15 out of the 40 customers who ordered a pastry also ordered an iced drink. \n",

    "### Computing Conditional Probabilities\n",
    "Formally, the conditional probability is computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align} P(A|B) = \\frac{P(AB)}{P(B)} &\\:  &\\:  &  P(B|A) = \\frac{P(AB)}{P(A)} \\end{align}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Shown below is a visualization of conditional probability. In the top plot, individual probabilities of event A and B are shown, as well as the probability that both A and B occur. The purple region represents the probability of the event AB occuring, while the red and blue regions correspond to A and B, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second and third plots, we see the resulting conditional probabilities after conditioning on either A or B. \n",
    "\n",
    "In plot 2, for example, we have reduced the event space to only consider cases for which event A has occurred. As a result, the only remaining cases where B occurs are those for which both A and B occur. The probability og B given A, then, can be seen as the proportion of the width of the colored region to the width of the entire plot."

    "In the last example, we specified a well-known distribution for our likelihood (Binomial) and for our prior (Beta). When we computed the posterior distribution, we obtained another Beta distribution with a new set of parameters. Maybe unsurprisingly, this is a desirable property. Potentially less obvious is that it is very rare in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the likelihood function $\\text P (X | \\theta, \\alpha) $  and prior distribution $ \\text P ( \\theta | \\alpha)$ produce a posterior distribution $ \\text P (\\theta | X, \\alpha) $ from the same family as the prior, then $ \\text P ( \\theta | \\alpha) $ is said to be a **conjugate prior** for $\\text P (X | \\theta, \\alpha)$.

    "### Working without conjugate priors\n",
    "\n",
    "Advancements in numerical, computational methods have relaxed the dependency on conjugate pairs. Approximating posterior distributions has been the subject of much research in recent decades, and these methods offer much greater flexibility compared to using conjugate pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A broad explanation of MCMC\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, let's recall the statement of Bayes' Rule we use in Bayesian inference:\n",
    "$$ \\text{P}(\\theta \\: | \\: X, \\alpha) = \\frac {\\text{P} (X|\\theta, \\alpha)  \\text{P}(\\theta|\\alpha)}{\\text{P}(X|\\alpha)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the term that is the most problematic to compute is the denominator, $ \\text P (X | \\alpha)$. In expanding this term, we see that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{P}(X|\\alpha) = \\int P(X|\\theta)P(\\theta|\\alpha) d\\theta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is the value obtained by integrating the numerator over all values of $\\theta$. Critically, though, $\\text{P}(X|\\alpha) $ does not rely on $\\theta$, i.e. it is constant with respect to $\\theta$. Essentially, this means that the denominator in this expression is used to normalize the values obtained in the numerator so as to obtain a proper probability distribution (i,e. to ensure that the posterior integrates to 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $\\text{P}(X|\\alpha)$ is constant, we can write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{P}(\\theta \\: | \\: X, \\alpha)\\propto \\text{P} (X|\\theta, \\alpha)  \\text{P}(\\theta|\\alpha)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we can use the value of the likelihood times the prior probability to compute the relative probabilities between any particular values of the posterior distribution. We can, in turn, use this to generate sample values of $\\theta$ with frequencies that approximate the density of the posterior. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is often done using **Markov Chain Monte Carlo** (MCMC) algorithms. A Markov Chain can be thought of as a probabilistic machine, which proceeds through a number of steps and transititions between a set of states randomly at each step. The probability of transitioning to a given state is based only on the current state. In other words, the probability of obtaining any value at a certain step in the chain is determined only by the previous step in the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of popular MCMC algorithms are given below:\n",
    "1. Metropolis-Hastings\n",
    "2. Gibbs Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Another algorithm that has gained popularity in the last few years is the **No U-Turn Sampler** (NUTS). This is techincally a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm as opposed to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The basic idea here is that the steps in an HMC are determined in a manner based on simulating a physical system. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, it's more helpful to focus on interpreting the results of an MCMC algorithm, because in practice we will use software libraries to implement the MCMC processes themselves. However, let's look at a brief and general overview of how the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm works, which will motivate an investigation into how we use these types of algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Metropolis-Hastings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a starting value for $\\theta$, $\\theta_0$ and compute $\\text P(X|\\theta_0)P(\\theta_0|\\alpha)$\n",
    "2. Based on some specified **candidate distribution**, generate a new value $\\theta_c$ and again compute $\\text P(X|\\theta_c)P(\\theta_c|\\alpha)$.\n",
    "3. Consider the value \n",
    "$$\\rho = \\frac {\\text P(X|\\theta_c) \\text P (\\theta_c | \\alpha)}{\\text P(X|\\theta_0) \\text P (\\theta_0 | \\alpha)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\rho > 1$, we \"accept\" $\\theta_1$, meaning we essentially append it to a running list of $\\theta$ values. \n",
    "If $\\rho < 1$, we may or may not accept it. In this case, we generate a value $u$ from a Uniform(0,1) distribution, and if $\\rho > u$, we accept $\\theta_c.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we reject $\\theta_c$, then we let $\\theta_1 = \\theta_0$. If we accept it, then we let $\\theta_1 = \\theta_c$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 a specified number of times. \n",
    "5. At the end of the process we have a sequence of $\\theta$ values. Our claim is that considering some subset of these values will give us a good approximate of the posterior density. Why is this?\n",
    "    - We used the candidate distribution to \"walk\" around possible $\\theta$ values. While doing so, we were more likely to accept values of $\\theta$ where $\\theta$ was very likely, i.e. in high density areas of the posterior distribution. We still accepted some values where $\\theta$ was less likely than the previous choice, allowing us to still venture into lower density areas.\n",
    "    - Not all values of $\\theta$ in our sequence are useful to us. Since we started at a (for the sake of our explanation) arbitrary point for $\\theta_0$, we're going to assume that it took a while for the Markov Chain to \"walk\" into a high density region of the posterior. As a result, we throw away some number of starting values. This is called \"burn-in\" or \"warm up\". \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Moreover, since we repeat values of $\\theta_i$ with some frequency, we're dealing with a lot of *autocorrelation*. As a result, after taking out the burn-in samples, we sometimes choose to only keep every other (or *k*th) sample.\n",
    "        - In recent years, thinning has become less popular. Consider the following: let's say we wanted to generate a chain of 50,000 $\\theta$ values, but to reduce autocorrelation we only keep every 4th sample. This means we had to generate 200,000 values in the first place. In some cases, then, the effect of discarding values may negatively impact performance more than the effect of autocorrelation."

    "\n",
    "After running an MCMC (or HMC), we generally want to start by looking at a plot of the approximated posterior distribution as well as a **trace plot**. The trace plot is a plot of the chain of values we obtained for each model parameter. Trace plots are particularly useful for identifying the dynamics of the fitting process. For instance, if the beginning of the plot has a lot of vertical motion before settling to a more stable series of values, this can signify that the algorithm had not yet reached a stable or stationary point yet. In this case, it is desirable to discard values as burn-in. "
